 This is my first solo project for JRS Coding Bootcamp. ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<h3 align="center">
One of my aims is to begin catching up on all the reading I've
              neglected for, well, the majority of my life. So, I started by
              researching several combinations of 'books to read before you
              die'. After carefully reading through what was on offer I decided
              to take the collective wisdom from the various sources by
              painstakingly comparing lists to determine how much overlap
              existed between them. I used this information to create a new list
              of the top books based on the number of times the book appeared as
              one of the list's recommendations. The more the book was referred
              to by the lists, the more the experts agreed, and that book became
              part of my new and improved books to read before you die list.</h3>
